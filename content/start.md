# Welcome to Digital Humanities: Knowledge Networks & Computation

**Your Personal Knowledge Management Lab**

Welcome to our introduction to digital humanities! This interactive environment combines the power of computational notebooks with personal knowledge management (PKM) techniques. Think of this as your "digital lab notebook" where you'll learn to connect ideas, build knowledge networks, and use computational tools for humanities research.

## üéØ What You'll Learn Here

- **Knowledge networking**: How to connect ideas across time and disciplines
- **Digital research methods**: Basic computational approaches to humanities questions  
- **Academic writing with code**: Integrating analysis and argumentation
- **Personal knowledge management**: Building systems to support lifelong learning

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Understanding This Interface
You're looking at a **markdown file** - a simple way to format text that's widely used in digital scholarship. Notice the floating button that says "üìù Switch to Edit" - click it to see the raw text behind this formatted view.

**Try it now**: Click the edit button, make a small change, then click the preview button to return to this view.

### Step 2: Your First Wikilink
Digital humanists often work with interconnected ideas. We use **wikilinks** to connect related concepts:

Try clicking this link: [[questions-I-have-about-dh]]

Notice it's red because the file doesn't exist yet. In PKM systems, clicking broken links creates new files - this is how knowledge networks grow organically.

### Step 3: Explore the Basics
Start your learning journey with these guided tutorials:

1. **[[interface-basics]]** - Learn the tools and keyboard shortcuts
2. **[[what-is-pkm]]** - Understanding personal knowledge management  
3. **[[connecting-ideas]]** - Building your first knowledge network
4. **[[computational-thinking]]** - Introduction to DH methods
5. **[[your-first-analysis]]** - Hands-on work with data

## üí° Your Learning Strategy

This environment is designed to help you **think like a digital humanist**:

1. **Make connections**: Use wikilinks to relate new concepts to what you already know
2. **Document your thinking**: Create notes about your questions and insights  
3. **Build progressively**: Start simple, add complexity as you learn
4. **Experiment safely**: This is your space to try things out

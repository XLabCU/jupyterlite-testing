# Formative Assessment 1: Building Your Digital Humanities Knowledge Network

**Due**: End of Week 3  
**Time**: Approximately 2-3 hours  
**Purpose**: Demonstrate understanding of PKM principles and digital humanities thinking through practical application

## Overview

This assessment asks you to create a small but meaningful knowledge network that demonstrates both your understanding of course concepts and your developing PKM skills. You'll build connections between ideas, document your thinking process, and reflect on how digital tools change humanities research.

## Part 1: Concept Mapping (40 points)

### Create and Connect Core Concepts
Create individual notes for each of these digital humanities concepts, then link them meaningfully:

**Required concept notes** (create one note for each):
1. [[digital-humanities-definition]] 
2. [[humanities-data]]
3. [[text-as-data]]
4. [[computational-thinking]]
5. [[networks-and-graphs]]
6. [[digital-archives]]
7. [[close-reading-vs-distant-reading]]

### Requirements for Each Concept Note:
- **50-100 words** defining the concept in your own words
- **At least 2 wikilinks** connecting to other concept notes
- **One example** of how this concept applies to humanities research
- **One question** the concept raises for you

### Example Structure:
```markdown
# Digital Archives

Digital archives are collections of cultural materials (texts, images, artifacts) 
that have been digitized and made accessible through computational interfaces. 
Unlike traditional [[physical-archives]], digital archives enable new forms of 
analysis through [[computational-thinking]] and can reveal patterns across 
large collections that would be impossible to detect through traditional 
[[close-reading-vs-distant-reading]].

## Example
The HathiTrust Digital Library contains millions of books that researchers 
can analyze for linguistic change over time, gender representation in 
literature, or the evolution of scientific concepts.

## My Question
How do the technical limitations of digitization (OCR errors, metadata 
inconsistencies) affect the kinds of research questions we can ask?

## Connections
- See also: [[humanities-data]] for data quality issues
- Related: [[text-as-data]] for computational approaches to digital texts
```

## Part 2: Research Interest Network (30 points)

### Build Your Personal Academic Network
Create a network of notes exploring your own research interests and how they connect to digital humanities methods.

**Required elements**:
1. **[[my-research-interests]]** - Central hub note describing your academic interests
2. **3-4 specific interest notes** - Detailed exploration of particular topics that interest you
3. **2-3 method notes** - Digital humanities approaches relevant to your interests
4. **Connection web** - Each note should link to at least 2 others

### Demonstrate PKM Principles:
- **Atomic notes**: Each note focuses on one clear idea
- **Progressive development**: Show how ideas build on each other
- **Non-linear connections**: Link concepts that might not obviously relate

## Part 3: Computational Integration (20 points)

### Connect Analysis to Interpretation
Choose ONE of these approaches:

**Option A: Embed from provided notebook**
- Use the provided [[sample-text-analysis.ipynb]] notebook
- Create a note called [[my-text-analysis-reflection]]
- Embed 2 different cells from the notebook using the syntax:
  - `![[sample-text-analysis.ipynb#cell:X:code]]` for code
  - `![[sample-text-analysis.ipynb#cell:Y:output]]` for results
- Write 2-3 sentences explaining what each embedded element shows
- Connect your reflection to broader concepts using wikilinks

**Option B: Create simple computational thinking note**
- Create [[computational-humanities-example]]
- Choose a humanities research question you're interested in
- Describe how computational methods might approach this question
- Link to relevant concept notes from Part 1
- No coding required - focus on thinking computationally about humanities problems

## Part 4: Reflection and Process (10 points)

### Document Your PKM Learning
Create a note called [[pkm-learning-reflection]] that addresses:

1. **Process reflection**: How did building this network change your understanding of the concepts?
2. **Connection discovery**: What unexpected connections did you discover while linking notes?
3. **Tool impact**: How did using wikilinks and backlinks affect your thinking process?
4. **Future application**: How might you use PKM approaches in your other coursework or research?

**Length**: 300-400 words

## Assessment Criteria

### Excellent (A range)
- All concept notes demonstrate clear understanding and meaningful connections
- Research interest network shows sophisticated thinking about personal academic development
- Computational integration demonstrates understanding of how digital methods inform humanities questions
- Reflection shows deep engagement with PKM principles
- Network demonstrates emergent properties (connections that reveal new insights)

### Good (B range)  
- Most concept notes are accurate and well-connected
- Research interests are clearly articulated with some digital humanities connections
- Basic computational integration with clear explanation
- Reflection shows engagement with course concepts
- Network shows understanding of linking principles

### Satisfactory (C range)
- Concept notes cover basic definitions with minimal connections
- Research interests identified but limited integration with digital humanities
- Minimal computational engagement or reflection
- Basic compliance with linking requirements
- Limited evidence of PKM thinking

## Submission Instructions

**No formal submission required** - your instructor will review your knowledge network directly in the system.

Ensure all required notes are created and properly linked. Use the backlinks panel (`Alt+B`) to verify connections are working.

## Tips for Success

### Start Early and Build Gradually
- Don't try to create everything at once
- Begin with concept definitions, then add connections
- Let your understanding develop through the linking process

### Use PKM Principles
- **Link liberally** - when in doubt, make the connection
- **Think atomically** - one clear idea per note
- **Embrace emergence** - let unexpected insights arise from the network

### Leverage the Tools
- Use `Alt+F` to search your network and discover existing connections
- Use `Alt+B` to see how concepts link back to each other
- Use auto-completion when creating wikilinks

### Make it Personal
- Connect course concepts to your own interests and experiences
- Ask genuine questions that interest you
- Build a network you'll want to return to and develop further

## Getting Help

If you encounter technical difficulties:
1. Review [[interface-basics]] for troubleshooting tips
2. Ask questions during class or office hours
3. Use the course discussion forum for peer support
